## Introduction 

The major challenge of the logistics industry is to come up with a delivery plan for hundreds and thousands of delivery clients with a given number of available vehicles. The optimal delivery plan should minimize cost and maximize efficiency. This mathematical problem is known as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). There are various constraints to consider in this problem such as the number of vehicles, vehicles' capacity, the time window of stores, number of depots, traffic, etc.

## Project Description

In this project, we look at the case of vrp with a single depot and a fixed number of vehicles. Here we try to minimize the total distance covered by the vehicles using D-Wave Systems. We compare various quantum algorithms against each other using different D-Wave solvers. We also compare quantum results against the classical CPLEX results.
